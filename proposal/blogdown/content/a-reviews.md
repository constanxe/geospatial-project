## An extended kernel density two-step floating catchment area method to analyze access to health care [(link)](https://journals-sagepub-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1068/b120050p)
This study looks into the improved version of two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method and the kernel density 2SFCA (KD2SFCA) method. The method was applied to assess the accessibility of the Portuguese hospital health care sector to see how well it performed as compared to the normal 2SFCA method. It was concluded that the KD2SFCA was able to better identify the accessibility of healthcare for the population. 

## Is there a Space for SAS® Viya® in Healthcare?
The aim of this study is to assess if the locations of current (and upcoming) healthcare facilities are equally accessible by the senior population in Singapore. 

Methodologies applied include the following: 
- Spatial point pattern analysis In the data exploration stage. They include Kernel Density Estimation, First Order Distance-based and Second Order Distance-based functions and are used to understand the distribution of General Practitioner (GP) clinics and the interaction between the distribution of these clinics and that of the population.
- Gravity models to evaluate the accessibility of healthcare services to the senior population. Examples include Hansen Potential Model, Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM) and 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA). 


## BURP [(link)](https://wiki.smu.edu.sg/1819t2is415/BURP_Project_Details)
This project looked into the impact of accessibility for families in residential housing after school mergers in Singapore. They calculated the distance of HDB flats to schools and used kernel density of HDBs as part of their algorithms. Isochrone maps were also used to showcase the results. We also tried out their application and evaluated them as follows.

Pros
- Logical to take public transport into account for accessibility
- Accessibility well displayed by travel time with public transport and Hansen - Accessibility (based on duration or distance)
- Kernel density is useful to see if HDB clusters are near a school 

Cons
- Unable to view the accessibility to schools given an address or location
- Only able to select 1 school at a time
- Only took residential HDB into account

Future works were also mentioned in the report. Our team will be seeing how we can implement the functionalities of identifying ideal locations for schools and allowing users to search a specific HDB block and show the nearest top 10 schools. This could be all types of schools to allow for better decision-making as there could be more than one child in the family.
