- Type of analysis, which can be one of the following options:
  - Hot & Cold Spot Areas (Getis-Ord Gi*)
  - Distance (Hansen Accessibility)
  - Kernel Density (KD2SFCA)
- Type of points the user wants to do the analysis on. It could be either population or housing data points
- Preferences to show accessibility points and/or legend, and the map type  

Users can also find out more information about the application and how to use it in the About tab.
