      <description>In our dashboard, we will have a Map and About tab. Users can find out more information about the application and how to use it in the About tab. In the map tab, they can apply various filters to see the results they want. Namely, they can choose the following:
 Region to see the schools in that area at one glance School(s) with multi-select enabled in the dropdown function Type of analysis, which can be one of the following options:  Hot &amp;amp; Cold Spot Areas (Getis-Ord Gi*) Distance (Hansen Accessibility) Kernel Density (KD2SFCA)   Type of points the user wants to do the analysis on.</description>

      <description>The main files driving the Shiny app dashboard that the user interacts with are as follows:
 UI.R is supported by the server for rendering information, and will showcase the functionality outputs on the maps. Users can further interact with the models by filtering the schools they want to look at, and there will be point markings, tooltips and legends provided to show additional information that may be useful. Server.R will do the back-end work, generating the information from the models.</description>

      <description>In our project, we will implement the methodologies covered by the case study, while also learning from the BURP application. We will also add in other functionalities not covered.
Getis and Ord’s G-Statistics
 Involves deriving adaptive proximity spatial weight matrix The Gi statistics will be computed and mapped for identification of the statistically significant hot spot and cold spot areas for where either high or low values (respectively) cluster spatially This method produced 1 map and is chosen over Local Moran’s I which requires us to compare the I value and p-value maps to come to a conclusion.</description>

      <description>BURP (link) This project looked into the impact of accessibility for families in residential housing after school mergers in Singapore. They calculated the distance of HDB flats to schools and used kernel density of HDBs as part of their algorithms. Isochrone maps were also used to showcase the results. We also tried out their application and evaluated them as follows.
Pros
 Logical to take public transport into account for accessibility Accessibility well displayed by travel time with public transport and Hansen - Accessibility (based on duration or distance) Kernel density is useful to see if HDB clusters are near a school  Cons</description>
